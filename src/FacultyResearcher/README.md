## Supported User Stories — Faculty Researcher

The Faculty Researcher is responsible for conducting research and supervising the research students. They need to reserve and use assets for projects, oversee the students’ use of equipment,
track patterns of lab equipment for their specific research group, and create reports to describe the use of assets.
They must also book equipment and software for their group, manage group members’ reservations, access dashboards with a summary of the usage data, and generate reports for resource usage.

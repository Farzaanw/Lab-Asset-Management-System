## Supported User Stories — Reservations

The reservations class is responsible for all the equipment and asset bookings made by faculty and students. It ensures equipment is properly maintained and recorded as checked out/checked in along
with the date and time of each reservation. Permissions will be permitted to actors, which will determine who can make certain reservations and see what reservations have been made.

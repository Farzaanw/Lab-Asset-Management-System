## Supported User Stories — Research Student

The primary responsibility of this class is to create research student objects and be a parent class to all users for our software.  The class will include attributes such as username and password,
which all other user classes will inherit.  This class will give a base level of privileges, allowing users to reserve non-restricted equipment and view what equipment is currently available.
